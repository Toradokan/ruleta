  >A pretty basic random quote generator for trying out progressive web apps.<br>
</div>


The app has only one button next on pressing which a random quote is displayed and that is pretty much it.<br>
The implementation was carried out using this [tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/progressive-web-apps-101-the-what-why-and-how-4aa5e9065ac2) as reference. Feel free to contribute or clone to take this further.
